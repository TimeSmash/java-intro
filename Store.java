// Similar to JS and Ruby, we have classes. Objects are instances of those classes.

//Objects have state: properties that are related to it in some way, like a bank account and its name, balance, interest rate...

//Objects also have behavior, actions they can perform. A bank account can deposit or withdraw money

// Classes are in UpperCamelCase
// Can inherit from superclass using extends followed by superclass name (ex. public class Sub extends Superclass)
// Can implement from interface, which is a collection of  abstract methods.

// Similar to JS and Ruby, we have classes. Objects are instances of those classes.

//Objects have state: properties that are related to it in some way, like a bank account and its name, balance, interest rate...

//Objects also have behavior, actions they can perform. A bank account can deposit or withdraw money

//Objects also have identity, a unique name. A bank account has a certain ID and can interact with other accounts

// When an object of a class is created, the class is said to be instantiated. All the instances share the attributes and the behavior of the class. But the values of those attributes, i.e. the state are unique for each object. A single class may have any number of instances.
